I set out to build a personalized portfolio website, aiming for a modern, responsive, and easily maintainable platform to showcase my projects, skills, and achievements. Hereâ€™s how I brought it to life:

## 1. Inspiration & Planning

I wanted a site that would not only serve as my digital resume but also reflect my personality and technical interests. My goals included:
- Easy deployment and updates via GitHub.
- Clean, professional, and mobile-friendly design.
- Fast development, with minimal setup hassle.

## 2. Discovering Vercel v0.dev

While researching efficient web development tools, I found [Vercel v0.dev](https://v0.dev/). This AI-powered platform can generate fully functional, stylish websites from simple text prompts. It stood out for its ability to:
- Instantly produce starter templates with best practices.
- Offer a well-structured codebase using modern frameworks like Next.js.
- Allow easy customization for content and style.

## 3. Generating My Portfolio
